# Welcome to My Coding Journey

## About Me

After two years of self-taught learning, I've grown from writing my first lines of code to developing more complex projects. My journey has been one of persistence and passion, learning step by step, improving line by line. Although I recently lost my original GitHub account, I'm starting fresh with the same drive and commitment that got me here. 

## The Journey So Far

These past two years have been an incredible period of growth:
- **Starting from scratch**: I began with the basics, learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, building small projects and gradually working up to more complex ideas.
- **Improving my skills**: I dedicated time to understanding programming concepts, algorithms, and best practices, pushing myself to become a better developer day by day.
- **Projects**: Although my previous repository is gone, I'm excited to begin building new projects and documenting my progress here once again.

## What's Next

With everything I've learned, I'm confident that the next two years will be even more rewarding. My focus is on:
- **Building more robust projects**: I aim to take my skills to the next level, working on full-stack development, game development, and contributing to open-source projects.
- **Growing my portfolio**: Every project will be a stepping stone, and I'll be sharing everything I create here, along with lessons learned along the way.
- **Continuous learning**: The world of technology is always evolving, and so will I—embracing new tools, languages, and frameworks as I go.

## Looking Forward

Although the loss of my first GitHub account was tough, it’s important to remember that the true value lies in the knowledge I’ve gained and the progress I’ve made. If I could grow so much in two years, I’m excited to see where I'll be in another two!

Let’s code onward and see where this new chapter leads!
